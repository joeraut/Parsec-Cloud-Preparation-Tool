OS:
Server 2016

Paperspace P5000  (Quadro P5000)

Issues:
Q. Stuck at downloading resouces for more than 1 minute
A. Close the Powershell window, delete the "ParsecTemp" folder on the Desktop, then right click Loader.ps1 from the extracted Zip and select "Run with Powershell" 
   You may see errors, but it will still work.

Q. Google P100 is stuck at 1366x768
A. I think this may be a limitation of the Azure Driver, though normally an unlicensed GRID Virtual Workstation driver allows
   you to max out at 2560x1600 on the Tesla M60 at least, but I'm not sure about the P100.

Q. What about GPU X or Cloud Server Y - when will they be supported?
A. That's on you!
